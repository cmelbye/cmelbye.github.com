	<h3>Recalculate your GPA</h3>
	<p>To recalculate your GPA by changing a grade in one of your classes, simply tap the class on the Courses page.</p>
	<p>This makes it easy and fast to experiment and see which grade you need in a class to attain a certain GPA.</p>
	<h3>Use your school's grade scale</h3>
	<p>To accommodate different grade scales at different schools, it's possible to select not only normal letter grades, but also A+, A-, B+, B-, etc.</p>
	<p>To ensure that your calculated GPA is accurate, choose only grades that your school officially uses.</p>
